Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the form of artificial neural networks (ANNs), has revolutionized the way machines process information, enabling systems to perform tasks traditionally requiring human cognition.
At the core of most modern AI systems lies the concept of a neural network, which is inspired by the structure of the human brain.
